# Basic-Intel-Thermal-Fix
Basic bash script (Arch) for fixing Intel's God awful thermal issue on 5th generation and further.


The script has been quickly made for sake of my sanity, meant to fix terrible intel mobile CPU thermal issues.
It installs few monitoring tools and software to fix the thermals (htop, lm_sensors, thermald and msr-tools.

The script disables turbo, due to it constantly running at high clock speed in idle.

It's nothing advanced, but it works. Currenly Arch only.
